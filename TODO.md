## Todo Items
V1 feature lists as follows:
 - ~~list all files of given dir path~~ 
  - read metadata of a file
    - ~~last modification date~~
    - ~~last access time of the file~~
  - show report of specific directory
  - implement recursive file meta searching
    - display files older that "x" days/months
	- check whether file is junk or not
  - if selected delete files
  
## Technical Debt.
 - update directory structure
 - add unit tests
 - refactor temporary hacked code
